# Weekend Challenge: SQL To-Do List

## Description

This is a full stack 'TO DO' application. Users can create a task which is stored inside of a database (SQL).  Users can see all task and mark each task as complete.  When users complete a task, it also gets deleted from the database.

## Technologies Used
- Javascript
- jQuery
- AJAX
- Node.js
- Express
- PostgreSQL
- PG

## What I Learned
- Write basic SQL queries
- Practice making GET, POST, DELETE, PUT requests
- Practice using ajax to update data on server

## Future Development

- `feature-completed-task-ordering` 
Adjust the logic so that completed tasks are brought to the bottom of the page, where the remaining tasks left to complete are brought to the top of the list.
